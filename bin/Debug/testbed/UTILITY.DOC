 The following Utilities are supplied with VTOS 3.0: BACKUP :s :d   This utility package is used to make a duplicate of adiskette.  The disk in drive 's' will be duplicated to thedisk in drive 'd'.  If the destination diskette is a blankdiskette, it will automatically be formatted before theduplication takes place.  If the drive specifications arethe same, the user will be prompted as to when each of thetwo disks and possibly a system disk should be inserted.   In order to help prevent unauthorized duplications, theuser must provide the source diskette's master password tothe BACKUP program.   You should not and can not use your VTOS 'MASTER' diskas an operational disk for day to day use.  You should onlyuse your 'MASTER' disk to produce your 'SYSTEM' disketteswhich a-r-e to be used on a daily basis.  Note that the'MASTER' and 'SYSTEM' diskettes are only for your own useand are not to be distributed to others.  VTOS data diskswith an undocumented master password should be used for thedistribution of your programs, etc.   VTOS 'SYSTEM' diskettes will back up to each other (orto blank diskettes) but not to data disks and vice versa.   It should also be noted that the BACKUP utility requiresan exact match in both the diskette name and password on bothdiskettes before an attempt to duplicate will be made.   This BACKUP utility, unlike others, will return controlto the VTOS system in an orderly manner and may thus beimbedded in an unattended CHAINing operation providing,obviously, that the user is not trying to perform a singledrive BACKUP. FORMAT   The format utility will format a blank diskette in orderfor the VTOS system to properly record data to/from the disk.The formats produced by the FORMAT and BACKUP utilities ofTRSDOS and NEWDOS are also compatible.   If the diskette to be formatted already contains data ofeither a compatible or incompatible format, a message will beissued along with the disk's name and creation date (whenpossible) informing the user of the circumstances and willthen allow the user to either continue or abort the FORMAToperation.   This FORMAT utility, unlike others, will return controlto the VTOS system in an orderly manner and may thus beimbedded in an unattended CHAINing operation. PATCH filespec1 filespec2   This utility will, hopefully, be your lifesaver if adefect is found in either the VTOS system, its utilities,or user programs which run under VTOS.  This utility willa program patch from an ASCII file (filespec2) to a programfile (filespec1).  The patch file should contains lines ofplain text which can be created in any number of differentways once the actual content of the patch is obtained.   The patch file contains two types of lines, commentsand patching instructions.  The comments must start with aperiod in the first position.  Patching instructions startwith the address followed by an equal sign and the new data.The data must be in hexadecimal digit pairs and a trailingsemicolon may be used to append an additional comment.  Seethe 'PENCIL/FIX' file elsewhere on this disk for an actualexample.   The default file extensions are 'CMD' for the program fileand 'FIX' for the patch file. DOLC/DVR   This is an upper/lower case driver for the display.  Thisdriver will allow programs to access the lower case displaycharacters, providing that the keyboard unit is properlymodified to include an additional memory chip.   This driver may only be made active by using the VTOS'SET' command.  For example,        SET *DO TO DOLC PR/DVR (<LINES=llll>,<CHARS=cccc>,<INDENT=iiii>)   This is a printer driver which allows narrow line widthprinters to be used with the system.  The driver may be setup with additional parameters governing its actual operation.This is similar to the other VTOS commands.  The options are:LINES=llll to establish the maximum number of lines per page(such as 6 for mailing labels), CHARS=cccc to establish themaximum number of characters on one line, INDENT=iiii whichis the indentation level to be used for lines which exceedcccc characters in length.   Again, use the VTOS 'SET' command as follows:     SET *PR TO PR (LINES=6,CHARS=40,INDENT=5) RS232/DVR (<BAUD=nnn>,<DTR>,<CD>,<RTS>,<CTS>,<EVEN>,<ODD>...)   This is a general purpose driver for the asyncrounouscommunications board that fits in the expansion interface.The options available are: BAUD=, CTS=, DSR=, CD=, RI=,DTR=, RTS=, EVEN, ODD, WORD=, STOP=, PARITY=(on/off).Most users will not even need to know half of these flagsbut for those who do need to know, the output signals maybe either set or cleared by setting the appropriate signalto either 'TRUE' or 'FALSE'.  For input signals, a 'TRUE'flag signifies that no data will be accepted until theassociated signal line is first in a true state.   Since several of these functions are already availablein the DIP switches on the interface board, those switchsettings will be used unless they are overridden by anoptional field.  A typical example is the BAUD rate.   The driver might become active with the following:        SET *CL TO RS232 (BAUD=1200) KSM/DVR filespec   This driver is the keystroke multiplication feature ofVTOS.  When this driver is made active in lieu of the *KIdriver, a predifined KSM file containing 26 phrases is readinto high memory and saved for later use.  The file iscomprised of from 1 to 26 phrases consisting of characterswhich are normally typed in manually via the *KI keyboarddriver.  Each phrase is associated with a keyboard characterand may be 'called up' be the associated keyboard functionkey (CLEAR and an alphanumeric key).  The keyboard shiftkeys are transparent to the phrasing routines in order toallow usage with a wider range of user programs.   It should be noted that since each phrase is terminatedwith a carriage return (ENTER), a carriage return withina KSM phrase file will not be multiplied out.  Instead, theuser should imbed semi-colons in the KSM file at the point(s)of desired carriage returns.   Function keys passed to the KSM driver which do not havean associated phrase will be passed on to the program whichwhich originally called for the input.   More than one KSM driver may be simultaneously active forthe same logical device.  In the case of conflicting phrases,the latter of the KSM drivers will have first shot at thefunction key.  See the 'KSM' drivers elsewhere on this disk.   Example:        SET *KI TO KSM USING VTOS KSR/CMD devspec   This is a keyboard send-receive terminal emulator.  Thelogical device specification for the RS232 interface to beused must be supplied.  Note that this allows this programto function with new hardware without a massive re-write.   Once active, the emulator will recognize the DUPLEX,ECHO, AUTO-LF, VTCOMM, VTOS, ON and OFF functions describedunder VTCOMM. VTCOMM/CMD devspec   This is a more advanced communications package whichallows machine-to-machine communications using any of thefollowing six logical devices: keyboard (*KI), display (*DO)printer (*PR), comm line (*CL), and file input (FI), andfile output (FO).   All memory not used for drivers (*CL, DOLC, KSM, etc.),is dynamically used for buffering the devices.  An exampleof this power comes from the fact that the printer can keepbusy for up to 24 minutes after all other I/O has ceased!!!   In order to make the functions easier to use, and allowsimultaneous KSM operation, the local functios are allimplemented on the numeric keys.  A tape containing each keysfunction placed directly above the top row of keys makes iteven easier.  The key definitions are as follows, remember tohold the 'CLEAR' key down during the keystroke:        1  KI           !  DUPLEX        2  DO           "  ECHO        3  PR           #  ---        4  CL           $  AUTO-LF        5  FI           %  REWIND        6  FO           &  PEOF        7  ---          '  ---        8  ---          (  ---        9  ID           )  VTCOMM        0  RESET        ------        :  ON           *  ---        -  OFF          =  VTOS   In order to turn a particular device or flag on or off,the function code for the device must first be depressedfollowed by the operation (ID, RESET, ON, OFF).   The VTCOMM flag indicates a compatable set of controlcodes are in use at the other end of the comm line.  Thiswill typically only be used for communicating with anotherVTCOMM program.
