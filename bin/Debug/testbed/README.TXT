           >>>>> Documentation Update - LDOS 5.3.1 <<<<<===============================================================This file will contain items of information which are pertinentto the operation of this DOS but which have not been printed inany "paper" documentation. The contents of this file may beprinted with the command: LIST README (P)===============================================================01/20/92:Applied KI1/FIX to correct screen print on Model 4;Applied TED5311/FIX to correct "Filespec?" prompt;Applied fix to FORMAT to correct hard drive FORMAT (SYSTEM)-----Note: Don't forget that all files associated with disk BASICuse a filename of BASIC - not LBASIC. If you are upgrading fromLDOS 5.1.4 or earlier, you may rename your old LBASIC files toBASIC. The password to use is ".BASIC". This is for LBASIC/CMD,LBASIC/OV1, LBASIC/OV2, and LBASIC/OV3.-----Note: BASIC will default to using a file extension of "/BAS"for program loading and saving. Please make sure your BASICprograms are named with this file extension or invoke BASICwith the command: BASIC (E=N). If you have a BASIC programwhich has no "/BAS" extension, then one of the following formsmust be used to run it:          RUN"MYFILE/       ........... no (E=N)          RUN"MYFILE        ........... (E=N) enteredNote the appended "/" in the former syntax. If you have a BASICprogram with a "/BAS" extension, then this is how you run it:          RUN"MYFILE        ........... no (E=N)          RUN"MYFILE/BAS    ........... (E=N) enteredNote that a program may easily be renamed to attach a "/BAS"extension with the following LDOS command:          RENAME MYFILE /BAS==============================================================Note to users of the MISOSYS MHDT34 hard drive:Because this release of LDOS regenerated system files, previousclock patches supplied with our MSCSI5 software are not usablewith this 5.3.1 release. The two clock patches provided on thisdisk, SYS0CLK5/FI1 and SYS3CLK5/FI1, are the ones to use. Pleasemake sure that when you apply the patch to SYS3/SYS, you applyit to a system disk in a drive other than :0. Swap drives asnecesary to accomplish that.-----Due to numerous requests concerning how to install 5.3 on aRadio Shack 4-head 5-Meg drive, we have added a JCL fileonto this disk. The "INIT54/JCL" configures a 4-head 5-Megdrive using "TRSHD3/DCT". This JCL assumes the drive is to bepartitioned as 4 logical drives (0, 1, 2, 3) and you have twofloppies (4, 5). To install LDOS 5.3 using this JCL file, BOOTwith a backup copy of 5.3 to which you have added a copy ofyour TRSHD3/DCT driver. Then issue the command:               DO = INIT54Please read all of the documentation supplied with YOUR harddrive before writing us if you do NOT understand what to do.We are not responsible for your HARD DISK.-----Note: When formatting a disk, the two '+' signs observed whenthe system information is being written denote the writing ofthe Granule Allocation Table and the Hash Index Table.-----If you are using double sided drives and wish to make a 2-sidedBOOTing SYSTEM disk, follow this procedure.     1. FORMAT a disk using (SIDES=2)     2. BACKUP SYS0/SYS:s :d (SYS)             where "s" is the source drive and             where "d" is the destination drive     3. BACKUP :s :d (SYS,INV)-----Note that the syntax of /FIX files for use with PATCH permitsa full colon, ":" only for use as a logical end-of-line orenclosed within quotes for a string patch ("this is ok:").-----Note that as supplied, the LDOS system disk is shipped to bootwith the slowest step rate and the longest dealy time afterselect. Your disk drives most likely can use a faster steprate; thus, please ensure you establish your boot disk as isappropriate for your system. Read about SYSTEM (STEP=n) andSYSTEM (DELAY=) in your user manual. Also use the properBSTEP= parameter when you format your working system disk.-----01/18/88 - Subject: Patch needed for COBOL programsSome of Radio Shack's software packages are compiled usingRS-COBOL. The RUNCOBOL/CMD program is coded to test theoperating system version number by comparing it against "51".Since our LDOS 5.3 release establishes "53" as the operatingsystem version (OSVER), these COBOL programs fail with usuallya Runtime error 20 or GAT error. To eliminate this problem, youcan usually patch the RUNCOBOL/CMD file to compare against"53". This  patch, typed from LDOS Ready, is as follows:       PATCH RUNCOBOL (D65,97=53:F65,97=51)Note: If this command aborts with the error "End of fileencountered", it means that the Radio Shack supplied FIX forthe hard disk operating system has not been applied to yourcopy of RUNCOBOL. See the instructions in your COBOLapplication manual for COBOLHD/FIX. Apply that first, thenretry the above patch.As more than one release of COBOL exists, this patch may notwork for you. Since we have not identified all of the versionsof COBOL which Radio Shack has released, the other alternativeis to patch LDOS to fool the world into thinking it is a 5.1release. Thus, if application of the above patch does not takeeffect, the alternative patch to LDOS on your startup floppyis as follows:       PATCH SYS0/SYS.SYSTEM:# (D02,8F=51:F02,8F=53)where "#" is replaced by the disk drive designation whichcontains your startup floppy disk.===============================================================ENDTXT
