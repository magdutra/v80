        EA/CMD         MODIFICATIONS BY V.B. HESTER         This program is a MICROSOFT copyright  item.  It  was  released  to  the      TRS 80  as  a  tape base unit (version 1.1). Apparat, Inc., added a disk      I/O appendage but did not enhance or correct several bugs.         Although I have fixed all know bugs and added several  enhancements,  I      don't  feel  I have the right to distribute the modified version without      paying  MICROSOFT  a  royality.  (MICROSOFT  has  not  been  given   the      opportunity  to  approve/disapprove  or  otherwise  negotiate  a royalty      schedule!)            However, the fixes  and  enhancements  may  be  useful  to  several      assembly language programmers.         I.      The Apparat modifictaion/appendage added disk I/O for source and  object      code. The "W" command and "L" command now require a "D="  or "T=" append      to envoke the respective function. The  "A"  command  without  the  "NO"      switch will self prompt the user for Disk or Tape. If the object file is      to go to tape, the NAME will be from the "A" command line. If the object      is  to go to disk, the user will be prompted for the file name in TRS 80      filespec syntax.           LT=TOPER this will load the source code for the file named "TOPER"           WD=TOPER/ASM this will now write the source code to disk         II.      When  EA/CMD  is  entered  the  user will be prompted to enter a "MEMORY      SIZE". The only need for an input other  than  <ENTER>,  is  to  protect      machine  language programs which reside in high memory and do NOT adjust      TOPMEM. (ALL MULTIDOS functions properly adjust TOPMEM).       A response of "BREAK" will recover  the  source  code  in  memory  if  a      premature exit was made. "IMMEDIATELY REENTER EA/CMD!         III.      1978, MODIFIED "T" COMMAND      Error  -  scrambled  print  out  text.  Most people never have used this      feature. However, to print out and/or transmit pure ASCII  source  code,      this fix was necessary (NOTE, tape version 1.2 fixed this error)        1979, MODIFIED "B" COMMAND      "B"  command  would  cause  a  REBOOT as patched by Apparat. Now the "B"      command has normal exit to DOS.


       1980, ADDED "C", "K", "V"      "C"  command  will  copy  a file from one disk to another or a file to a      different filename on the same diskette. (MULTIDOS SYSTEM must remain in      drive 0) The copy syntax requires both filespecs.       C TEST0/ASM:0 to :1 won't work as expected, error generated      C TEST/ASM:1 to TEST1/ASM:2        The "K" command will delete a file.      K TEST3/ASM:2        The "V" command will display a directory.      V[:]2      The  Model  III uses the 4419H call for the directory. (Model I contains      code in EA/CMD)             V:0(S)    OK           V:1(I)    OK           V:1(S,I)  won't work as expected (no error)           V(S)      won't work as expected (no error)       The  "V"  command on the Model I includes invisible and system files. On      the Model III, the option (I) is necessary for invisible files  and  the      option (S) will include BOTH invisible and system files.        1980, MODIFIED KEY INPUT      The  original  version  1.1,  did  not convert case. A shifted character      appeared as uppercase on  the  original  TRS 80;  however,  these  would      produce  an  error  during  assembly. Apparat added a case conversion to      eliminate this problem.       The  Apparat  modification  was  revised  using  their  "code  area"  to      recognize  the  "CLEAR"  key.  (LOWER  CASE is acceptable in remarks and      DEFM'S)        1981, MODIFIED INDEX REGISTER offset      I don't recall the original limitations  but  do  recall  the  need  for      change.  Whenever an index offset is specified the assembler will modulo      256.            Permitted are:           (IX+1), (IX+0FEH)           (IX-1), (IX-0DCH), etc.        1981, MODIFIED DISK I/0      Modified to better handle MULTIDOS DISK I/O. (Not the same  as  NEWDOS).
