APPEND filespec1 <prep> filespec2   The APPEND command appends two files together.  The firstfile specified is appended to the end of the second filespecified. ATTRIB filespec (<ACC=xxx>,<UPD=yyy>,<PROT=zzz>,<INV>,<VIS>)   The ATTRIB command alters a file's protection attributes.The access and update passwords will be changed to xxx andyyy respectively, while the level of protection granted tothose knowing only the access password will be limited tozzz.  The values zzz may take on are: EXEC(ute only),READ (only), WRIT(e), RENA(me), NAME, KILL, or FULL.   The 'INV' and 'VIS' options are used to declare the fileas either an invisible file or a visible one, respectively. AUTO <command line>   The AUTO command will cause the specified command lineto be executed every time the system is powered on or reset. BASIC2   This command transfers control to ROM resident BASIC. BOOT   This command causes the disk in drive zero to be rebootedinto the system.  This has the same effect as the resetpushbutton switch on the back of the keyboard unit. CHAIN filespec   The CHAIN command enables the user to employ a disk filecontaining a sequence of job control language procedures(sometimes referred to as JCL) which would otherwise haveto be entered one at a time by the user.  All programs whichwork with the normal keyboard line input handler (KEYIN) willwill work under CHAINing.  It should be noted that the singlecharacter input handlers (KBD, KEY, and INKEY$) will stilluse the actual keyboard for their input.   The user must be aware during the creation of the JCL fileof the exact sequence of input requirements that the programswill encounter.   Chain files may be linked together but not nested.  A loopmay be created by CHAINing back into itself.  The BREAK keywill be active during the fetching of each input line andwill cause a MANUAL CHAINING ABORT condition.  An END-OF-FILEcondition will issue a message to the display (without anyactual input) and return control to the previous *KI driver.   The default file extension is 'JCL'.CLOCK (<flag>)   This command will turn the realtime clock display on oroff according to the stated flag condition. COPY filespec1/devspec1 <prep> filespec2/devspec2   The COPY command will copy data from the first file ordevice to the second file or device.  If either specificationis for a device, the copy will be performed on a characterby character basis.  Otherwise, the copy will be performedon a sector by sector basis for speed sake.   This command is useful for quickly creating an input filefor a program CHAINing operation or a keyboard re-definitionfile for keystroke multiply (KSM) applications.   The operation may be aborted at any time with the BREAKkey. DATE mm/dd/yy   This command resets the internal realtime date to thatwhich is specified. DEBUG (EXT)   The DEBUG command, unlike all other commands, does notappear to perform an immediate task.  Instead, it simplyenables an internal GHOST which waits for the appropriatetime to show itself.  Those times are: 1) when the BREAKkey is depressed, 2) after a program has been loaded andthe first instruction in the program is about to be executedand, 3) after any type of an error which would otherwiseterminate via the ABORT entry point into the system.   It should be noted that this debugging facility willbe disabled during the execution of any EXECute onlyprograms.   The following commands are available once the user hasentered the debugger:        A               alphanumeric display mode        C               instruction / call step        Daaaa           set memory display address                        to aaaa        Gaaaa<,bbbb<,cccc>>  GO TO address aaaa,                        optionally set breakpoints                        at addresses bbbb and cccc        H               set hexadecimal display mode        I               single instruction step        M<aaaa>         set memory modification mode,                        optionally starting at address                        aaaa.        Rrp dddd        alter register pair 'rp' to                        become dddd        S               set full screen display mode        U               dynamic display update mode        X               set processor examine mode        ; or +          increment the memory display                        address 'page'        -               decrement the memory display                        address 'page'   The following additional commands are available underthe extended debugging package by requesting (EXT) on theinitial DEBUGging command.  Note the the extended packagewill be loaded into high memory and might cause a conflictwith those programs which do not use HIGH$ to determine themaximum usable memory address.        E<aaaa>         enter data into memory, optionally                        starting at address aaaa        Faaaa,bbbb,dd   fill memory from aaaa to bbbb,                        inclusively, with the byte cc        L<aaaa>,<dd>    locate the next occurrance of                        the data byte dd. Both aaaa and                        dd are optional        O               normal return to VTOS        Paaaa,bbbb      print memory from aaaa through                        bbbb, inclusively, in both hex                        and ascii.        Qii'ENTER'      Query input port ii for data        Qoo dd          set output port oo to dd        T<aaaa>         type ascii data into memory,                        optionally starting at address                        aaaa.        W<aaaa>,<dddd>  search memory for the next occurrance                        of the data word dddd (in reverse                        format) and indicate the referencing                        instruction.  Both aaaa and dddd are                        optional.        d,t,s,o,aaaa    transfer a track or sector to/from                        a disk unit.  d is the drive, t is                        the track, s is the sector, and aaaa                        is the starting memory address to be                        used for the transfer.  o is either                        an R for read or a W for write.  A                        full track read/write will occur if                        the sector number is null (the commas                        are still required). DEVICE   The DEVICE command will cause all logical devices whichare currently enabled in the system to be displayed alongwith I/O direction (indicated with < and > symbols), andany ROUTE-ing which has been performed, as well as theaddress of the actual I/O driver module currently in use. DIR :d (A,I,P,S)   This is the directory command which is used to obtainan itemization of the files currently residing on a disk.Includes in the itemization is the file's protection level,the end-of-file record number, the number of discontiguoussegments containing the file, and the total number of storagegranules which the file occupies (1.25K bytes per GRAN).   The d is used to specify which drive is desired, whilethe other optional flags are used to indicate whether anallocation itemization is desired (A), and whether theinvisible files (I), and system files (S) are to be inclu-ded as well as whether an additional printed directory (P)is to be produced. DUMP filespec (<START=ssss>,<END=eeee>,<TRA=tttt>)   The DUMP command dumps memory from the starting addressaaaa through the ending address eeee to the specified diskfile.  The file will include the transfer address tttt,if specified, otherwise, the transfer will be back to thesystem.   The keywords START, END, and TRA may be abbre-viated as S, E, and T, respectively.  Either decimal orhexadecimal addresses (preceeded by X') may be used.   The default file extension is 'CIM' (core image). FREE   This command is used to obtain a summary of the amountof unallocated (free) disk space and directory entries onall mounted disks. KILL filespec/devspec   The KILL command is used to delete the specified fileor device from the system. LIB   Display the primary command library. LINK devspec1 <prep> devspec2   This command is used to link input and output to/fromtwo or more logical I/O devices together.  Once linked,all output sent to the first device will also be sent tothe second and all input requested from the first devicemay be satisfied from either device.   Note that the actual order or occurrance is importantand that two LINKs of the same two devices but in thereverse order will produce an endless condition. LIST filespec/devspec (NUM,LINE=llll,HEX,REC=rrrr)   The LIST command is used to display a listing of a fileor device on the *DO device.  Optionally, line numbering(NUM) and/or hexadecimal listing (HEX) may be specified.   A starting line number (LINE=llll) for an ASCII fileor a starting record number (REC=rrrr) for a HEXadecimalfile may be specified.   The default file extensions are 'TXT' and spaces. LOAD filespec (X)   The LOAD command is used to load a command file (/CMD)or a core image file (/CIM) into memory without execution.   This command is especially useful for the single disksystem where a program which does not reside on the VTOSsystem disk is to be loaded.  The user will be promptedfor the appropriate disk insertions if the 'X' option isspecified.   Note that the file must be at least a read only file.   The default file extension is 'CMD'. PAUSE comment   The PAUSE command is used to insert an indefinite timedelay into a CHAINing file's execution.  Execution willcontinue when either the 'ENTER' or 'BREAK' key is depressed. PRINT filespec/devspec   The PRINT command is similar to the LIST command with theexeception that the output is directed to the line printerand the output obtained for a hexadecimal print is formatteddifferently.  See LIST for options available.   The default file extensions are 'TXT' and spaces. PROT :d (<LOCK>,<UNLOCK>,<PW>,<NAME>)   The PROTect command is used to alter the master protectioninformation on a diskette.  The 'LOCK' and 'UNLOCK' optionscause all non-system, non-invisible files to have both theirACCess and UPDate passwords altered to either the masterpassword for that diskette or to blanks, respectively.   The other options request that either the master diskpassword or the disk's name be altered.   In all cases, the user will first be required to furnishthe current master password for the disk in question withfollow-on prompting as appropriate. PURGE :d   The PURGE command provides a quick manner in which toeliminate unwanted 'clutter' which collects on a diskette.   All files (except BOOT and DIR) will be listed one at a time, and the user will respond with either 'Y' to purge thefile, or 'N' (or 'ENTER') to leave the file intact.   Due to the severity of this command, the user will firsthave to provide the disk's master password to the utility. RENAME filespec1 <prep> filespec2   This command renames a file from the name provided infilespec1 to that provided in filespec2.  Note that thesecond filespec must NOT have a drive number specified. RESET <devspec>   This command will reset specified logical devices.  Ifthe device is a standard system device, it will be resetto its normal system power-on driver.  If the device isa non-standard device, it will be set to a 'NIL' driver,i.e. no input and all output ignored.   Note that a RESET may be performed without a specifieddevice will reset all system devices and clear all otherdevices.  This will also reset HIGH$ to the top high endor physical memory. ROUTE devspec1 <(NIL)> <prep> <filespec/devspec2>   The ROUTE command creates and/or re-routes I/O for alogical device (devspec1) to either a bit-bucket (NIL),or a disk file, or a different logical device.   Note that if the routing is made to a disk file, botha device control block (DCB) and a blocking buffer willbe dynamically allocated in high memory. RUN filespec   The RUN command causes the specified program to beloaded into memory and executed.   The RUN command is especially useful for the singledisk system in that it allows the user to run programswhich do not reside on the VTOS system disk.  When the'X' option is requested, the 'RUN' command will promptthe user for the appropriate disk to be inserted in theuser's drive.   The default file extension is 'CMD'. SET devspec <prep> filespec <coniguration params>   The SET command is used to establish a new logical I/Odevice into the VTOS system.  This driver will be activeuntil the device is either RESET, ROUTEd, SET to a differentdriver, or the system is RESET.   The default file extension is 'DVR'. TIME hh:mm:ss   This command is used to set or reset the system's internalrealtime clock.  No display is associated with this command.See 'CLOCK' for further details. TRACE (flag)   This command displays the user's program instructioncounter (PC) on a realtime basis.  Four hexadecimal digitsare forcibly placed on the top line of the display and willcontinuously be updated with the current program's executionaddress. VERIFY (flag)   The VERIFY command forces ALL disk write to be performedwith read-after-write verification regardless of the actualsystem call.  Normally, only writes to VTOS system tablesand specific user calls to VERIFY will be performed withthis read-after-write verification. XFER filespec   This command exists primarily for the single disk systemuser.  Its function is similar to COPY except that XFERwill transfer a file from one diskette to another withoutrequiring a VTOS system present on either of the two datadiskettes.  Appropriate user prompts will be made as eachof the two data diskettes as well as a third system disketteshould be inserted into the drive.   The filespec may contain a non-zero drive specification.
