'VIRTUAL TECHNOLOGY OPERATING SYSTEM Version 3.0' containsnumerous internal operational features and characteristicswhich improve reliability, simplify usability, and eliminatemany of the user frustrations found in TRSDOS, NEWDOS, andother operating systems for the TRS-80. The following is a partial list of several of these featureswhich you may interested in knowing about:   1) Interrupts are disabled only during actual I/O transfers     and therefore do not produce a slow 'realtime' clock or     other foreground task or interrupt processing 'Jitter'   2) Interrupt processing overhead has been reduced 50%     by ignoring the secondary post-interrupt partial      interrupt sequence occuring in the hardware.   3) False "LOST DATA DURING READ" error messages do not     occur.   4) False GAT/HIT/DIRECTORY READ/WRITE error messages     do not occur.   5) 'Silent Death' does not occur.   6) Disk drive 'Motor-on Delay' will not during lengthy     track seek operations.   7) Commands attempting to access non-existant or empty     disk drives (e.g. DIR) will not 'hang system.   8) 'Unreadable Files' due to inappropriate End-Of-File     processing do not occur.   9) Files which end exactly on a sector boundary may be     read without any difficulty.  10) Excess allocated update space after a file's EOF mark     is only a partial granule thereby not wasting an extra     granule for this purpose.  11) Disk space which has been allocated to a file yet is     not actually used by that file (e.g. past EOF) is     released by the system when the file is CLOSEd unless     the file was being read from a write-protected disk.  12) 'Variable Length' file support which automatically     blocks short user data records within a sector and     across sector boundaries thereby making full use of     disk file space.  13) 'Keyboard Bounce' does not occur.  14) Keyboard 'Control Key' does not produce extra CNTL-Z.  15) Keyboard 'Shift Case' reversal key.  16) Keyboard 'Function' character set (128 chars) available     thereby allowing special functions to be implemented     by the user's program.  17) Keyboard 'Control', 'Function', and display characters     internally decifered by the system for user programming     ease.  18) Keyboard auto-repeat feature operational over entire      keyboard including 'Control' and 'Function' keys.  19) Lexical scanner in command interpreter allows the user     to input free-format command lines.  20) Parameter scanner will pass symbolic, logical, decimal,     hexadecimal, an string parameters to a user's program.  21) Default file extensions automatically supplied by system     utilities for user ease in effectively separating file     contents according to their extensions.
