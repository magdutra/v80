Syntax is: CALC expression (such as CALC 2+12*6, / CALC SQR(81), etc.). Does not seem to always properly recognize parenthesisCHECKER/BAS  - Compares two BASIC programs saved in ASCII format and prints out differencesCOMPARE/CMD  - Compares two files byte by byte. Syntax is: COMPARE filespec1 filespec2. Searches for filename in INBUF$ (4318H in Model I, 4425H in Model III). Under MULTIDOS and DOSPLUS 3.5 (which allow multiple commands), if COMPARE/CMD is renamed to V/CMD, COPY TEST/CMD:1 :2,V will copy and then verify the copy. SPACE pauses display, ENTER restarts, BREAK aborts. Superseded by V/CMD program on disk PD #3DISKINDX/BAS - Prints DISKINDX/DAT file created DISKINDX/CMDDISKINDX/CMD - Public Domain disk cataloging program that will hold 2500 filenamesDISKINDX/DOC - Documentation for DISKINDX/CMDDOU/CMD      - Permits execution of multple commands by entering a single command from "DOS Ready" (similar to /JCL file)DOU/DOC      - Documentation for DOU/CMDLOADADDR/BAS - Examines /CMD format files on disk, displays exactly where program loads in memory (incl. non-contiguous blocks)NOTE/CMD     - Lets you leave messages, comments, instructions, etc. on your disk. Run program for instructionsORGAN/CMD    - Lets you play music through an external amplifier connected to the cassette output jackPERUSE/CMD   - Creates a program that will display text one letter at a time at normal reading speed. Does not allow reader to pause or abort. Syntax: PERUSE TEXT/TXT:2 (default extension /TXT is assumed if not specified). Output file has same filename and /CMD extension. Input text file must consist of alphanumeric characters, linefeeds and carriage returns only. Program will not break a word in the middlePILOT/BAS    - BASIC program pokes a PILOT language interpreter into high memoryPILOT/INS    - Instructions for PILOT/BAS in PILOT. Run PILOT/BAS, then LOAD"PILOT/INS", then type NAME to executeREPLACER/BAS - Replace (Change) variable names in a BASIC programREPLACER/DOC - Documentation for REPLACER/BASSCHEDULE/BAS - Maintains database of time and date related events, such as appointments, etc.SETDATE/ASM  - Source code for SETDATE/CMD, includes program documentation in comment linesSETDATE/CMD  - Ends hassle of setting date at power-up or reboot. Documentation in SETDATE/ASM comment linesSUPERLST/CMD - BASIC program lister utilitySUPERLST/DOC - Documentation for SUPERLST/CMD
