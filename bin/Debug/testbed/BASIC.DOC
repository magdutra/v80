DISK BASIC RENUMBER-------------------        This command will renumber your BASIC programmodifying all line number references, such as GOTO's,as well as the line numbers themselves. The form of thecommand is:             CMD"N ! aaaa,bbbb,cccc,dddd"             All of the parameters in this command are optional.The bang (!) means to skip the prescan for errors and tobegin renumbering immediately. Do NOT use this optionunless you are sure the program will renumber withouterrors. If this option is not set, a prescan will bedone to first see if the program can be renumbered withouterrors. If errors are found during the prescan, theprogram will remain unchanged, making it much easier tofix.     The four remaining optional fields are all numeric.Field aaaa is the number of the first line on whichrenumbering is to begin. Field bbbb is the new linenumber to be assigned to that line. Field cccc is theincrement value. Field dddd is the number of the lastline of the program to be renumbered. Any field notspecified will use the default values of:             aaaa = 1     starting at line # 1        bbbb = 20    make it line # 20        cccc = 20    increment each line following by 20        dddd = 65529 until line 65529 is encountered           If the parameters you supply would result inthe line numbers being out of sequence upon completion,a "BAD PARAMETERS" error will result which is alwaysnon-fatal.        By selecting the proper parameters, you mayrenumber only part of your program without changingthe line numbers in the rest of the program; i.e.,renumber only the middle but not the beginning or the end.          DISK BASIC XREF UTILITY-----------------------        This command will produce a listing of linenumber and variable references of your BASIC program.The form of the command is:            CMD"X device/filespec -a <title of listing>"             All parameters are optional. Device/filespecis the name of the file or device which the listingis to be sent to. The listing is formatted to printa maximum of 56 lines to a page and includes form feedcharacters. The default parameter is *DO which causesthe listing to appear on the screen.        Option -a may take on one of three forms. Ifthis option is entered as -V, the listing will includeonly variables. If the option -L is used, only line numberreferences will be listed. Instead of a dash, if anequal symbol is used followed immediately by the name ofeither a line number or a variable, only that line numberor variable will be cross-referenced. If none of theseoptions is specified, the all line numbers and variableswill be listed.        The last option is a title which is to appearon the top of each page. It must be enclosed insideof greater-than/less-than symbols.        The listing can temporarily be halted by pressingthe SHIFTED @ key or can be aborted by pressing theBREAK key.
