SIX2XTND(C) Version 1.2.2 06/06/87 - UPDATE FOR TRSDOS 6.2.x Model 4This software consisting of a set of patches and a conversion program willenable you to continue to use your TRSDOS 6.2.x operating system past 1987 tothe year 2092. The USER password has been eliminated, but all other passwordsremain. SIX2XTND is not PUBLIC DOMAIN. It is SHAREWARE. It has takenconsiderable time to develop and test. Therefore, if you use the productplease send $15.00US to the address at the end of this text. Pleaseread the license agreement. LDOS 5.1.4 versions for the Model 1 and Model 3are also available.INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH FLOPPY AND HARD-DRIVE USERSBefore performing this or any upgrade it is highly recommended that you workonly on backups of your disks until you are reasonably satisfied this or any upgrade meets your needs. To get a printed copy of the JCL files that are used type each of thefollowing commands: Note ENTER is the ENTER keyLIST SIX2XTB/JCL (P) ENTERLIST SIX2XTC/JCL (P) ENTERLIST SIX22000/JCL (P) ENTERTo make Backups insert the TRSDOS 6.2.x system disk in drive 0. BOOT thesystem. Place a blank diskette in drive 1 and type in the following command:FORMAT :1 (ABS,Q=N,NAME="TRSDOS62")When it is finished, type in the following command:BACKUP :0 :1Repeat the process. Once you have your two backup copies of the original TRSDOS 6.2.x system disk, insert one of them in drive 0. Insert the SIX2XTNDdisk in drive 1.BOOT the SYSTEM so that you are using the operating system in drive 0. It is important that you enter the correct date.Type in the following command:DO SIX2XTB (S=1,D=0,R1)where S is the SOURCE drive where one on the backup 6.2.x system disks isD is the DESTINATION drive where the SIX2XTND disk isR1 is for TRSDOS 6.2.1. Use R0 for TRSDOS 6.2.0.Follow the instructions to the letter. The JCL has been tested on both 6.2.0 Level -AN and 6.2.1 Level -AR system disks. After completing this job it isnow recommended that you update all your disks by using the DATECONV program.To convert your system disks you can choose either of the followingprocedures.1. Apply the patches to each system disk using the SIX2XTB JCL.2. BOOT the system disk to be changed in drive 0.   Place the TRSDOS 6.2.x+ disk in drive 1.   Type in the following command:DO SIX2XTC (S=1,D=0)where S is the SOURCE drive for your new TRSDOS 6.2.x+ diskD is the DESTINATION drive where you have the system disk to be converted   Once this is complete you will have to do a SYSTEM (SYSGEN) if you have   a CONFIG file.The above JCL can be used for hard disk system drives as wellTo convert a DATA disk simply type in the command:DATECONV (D=1)where D is the DESTINATION drive where you have the disk to be convertedAnswer the prompt as to what version of the operating system the disk was run on. If you type in DATECONV with no parameters, DATECONV will list theparameters that can be used and what each means.Notes on the DATECONV programDATECONV will convert any drive 0-7. There is no default, the drive parametermust be enteredIf DATECONV finds an invalid or missing date the default date of 01/01/80 isused. If you wish to use another year add O=YY, where YY is the year 00-99,to the DATECONV parameters. e.g. DATECONV (d=1,o=75)DATECONV provides for conversion of dates on disks from several operatingsystems.Option 1 will convert TRSDOS 6.2.x disks to TRSDOS 6.2.x+ disks. Thisoption will only change dates of files with a null user password (9642H). Thusif you copy a file into your TRSDOS 6.2.x+ disk you could re-run DATECONV withoption 1 to change the date on that file only. Option 1 checks that the diskis a TRSDOS 6.2.x disk and issues an error message if not. This option can beused for TRSDOS 6.2.X disks.Option 2 will convert a disk from TRSDOS 6.2.x+ to TRSDOS 6.2.x. Option 2checks that the disk is a TRSDOS 6.2.x+ disk and issues an error message ifnot.Option 3 converts a LS-DOS 6.3 disk to a TRSDOS 6.2.x+ disk. Option 3 checksthe disk is a LS-DOS 6.3 disk and issues an error message if not. This optioncan be used for LDOS 5.3 disks.Option 4 converts a TRSDOS 6.2.x+ disk to a LS-DOS 6.3 disk. Option 4 checksthe disk is a TRSDOS 6.2.x+ disk and issues an error message if not.Option 5 converts a DOSPLUS 1.0 disk to a TRSDOS 6.2.x+ disk. This option ishere primarily to change dates on the disk prior to moving over to a TRSDOS 6.2.x+ disk. No further testing has been done on the DOSPLUS disk.Option 5 checks to make sure it is a DOSPLUS disk and issues an errormessage if not.At the year 2000 there are 2 patches to be done. These are SYS02000/FIX andSYS72000/FIX. Insert the TRSDOS 6.2.x+ disk in drive 0 and the SIX2XTND diskin drive 1 and the the command:DO SIX22000 (S=1,D=0)Where S is the SOURCE drive you have the SIX2XTND disk in.      D is the DESTINATION drive where you have the TRSDOS 6.2.x+ disk in.You will need to do this on all your system disks.TECHNICAL INFORMATIONSYSTEM OVERLAYS/PROGRAMS AFFECTEDBOOT - change level to XTSYS0 - initial boot up date editing and displaySYS2 - OPEN - removal of USER password testSYS3 - CLOSE - change in storing of date on directory entrySYS6 - DIR - editing and display of dates and date parameterSYS7 - ATTRIB - removal of USER password parameterSYS7 - DATE - editing and displaySYS7 - PURGE -editing and display of dates and date parameterBACKUP - editing and display of dates and date parameterFORMAT - change of disk type and default dates for BOOT/SYS AND DIR/SYSMEMDISK- change of disk type for double density only Other than the removal of the USER password all existing TRSDOS commandsshould work without change.DIRECTORY CHANGESGAT - The disk type byte (GAT +CDH) now uses bit 3 to indicate a TRSDOS 6.2.x+disk.DIR+1 bits 3-0 is now zeros (was the month)DIR+2 bits 7-0 is now the year (was the year and day)DIR+18 bits 7-0 is now the day (was part of USER password)DIR+19 bits 7-0 is now the month (was part of USER password)SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENTThis software upgrade provided by MICHAEL JACOBS CONSULTING is intended forlegitimate owners of a TRSDOS 6.2.x operating system.

It is a TRSDOS feature to defaultthe user password to the owner password if none is supplied. DATECONV usuallytests for no user password (9642H) and certain system passwords. Thus if youdo not have many password protected files you can simply remove the passwordusing the ATTRIB command, run DATECONV, then re-apply the passwords. Anotheralternative is to use a ZAPPER program such as LSFEDII to change the userpassword area to 9642H and then run DATECONV. There is another way, but thisrequires an absolute understanding of the following. There is an undocumentedfeature in DATECONV which will not check if the user password area is null.If you use this feature, it can only be used the first time you run DATECONVon the disk. Otherwise, all the dates already converted will go to the defaultbad date. To use this option enter the following command:DATECONV (D=1,ALL)where D is the destination drive
